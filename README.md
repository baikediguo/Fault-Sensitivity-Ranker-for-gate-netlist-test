# Fault-Sensitivity-Ranker-for-gate-netlist-test
Using AI (especially graph neural networks) to predict or rank the likelihood of faults at each node in a Verilog circuit netlist without explicitly injecting faults. We will establish an unsupervised/self-supervised scoring system that infers 'which nodes have complex structures and critical connections' based on structure and type, assuming these points are more likely to be fault propagation sources or fault-sensitive points.
